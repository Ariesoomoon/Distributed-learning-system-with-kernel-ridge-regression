# Distributed-learning-system-with-kernel-ridge-regression

To further demonstrate the power of this novel distributed learning scheme, the same four sets of experiments as toy simulations are conducted in appendix using the **kernel ridge regression(KRR)**, **AdaBoost** and **random forest(RF)** algorithms on local agents. 

Please refer to the README.md of **Distributed-learning-system-with-local-average-regression**.
